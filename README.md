# Elevator System. A Case Study of Coloured Petri Nets


## Abstract
A fairly general model of the elevator system is presented. Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) and CPN tools are adopted as modeling tools. The model, which is independent of the number of floors and elevators, covers different stages of the elevator system in substantial detail. The model assists simulation-based analysis of different algorithms and rules which govern real elevator systems, including calculating serv- ing time and waiting time. The results prove the compatibility and applicability of this model in various situations and demonstrate the expressive power and convenience of CPN.
